# Kaushik’s Career Strategy Team (Custom GPT)

A career decision and materials optimization agent designed as a 3-persona council:

- **Seasoned Recruiter (20+ years)** — recruiter scan behavior, shortlisting, offer dynamics
- **HR Business Partner (20+ years)** — org fit, leadership calibration, culture/comp, coaching lens
- **Resume Writer & Career Brand Strategist (20+ years)** — narrative, ATS clarity, positioning

This GPT is built to be **truth-first**, **human-authentic**, and **protective** of long-term career trajectory.
